Product management system for managers and customers
### build product
```
ng build --configuration production
```
### run product
```
ng serve --configuration production
```
### product management system
```
This is a basic example of how you might structure a product management system using Angular. The system should have a user interface that allows managers to create, read, update, and delete products.
